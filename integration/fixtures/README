A note about adding new tests:
    - If you want to add a new data file, please do so
      in the specified folder (i.e csv files in the fixtures/csv)
    - Unfortunately the config.yaml file has to contain file paths
      relative to the test executed - thus the "../fixtures/...".
    - If you want to add a test that
        - Tests a specific type of datasource then put it in
          the appropriate datasource folder
        - Tests that test some general query should go to the
          "general" folder
